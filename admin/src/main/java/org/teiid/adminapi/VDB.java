/**
 * Represents a Virtual Database in the Teiid System.
 * <br>A VDB has a name and a version.</br>
 * 
 * <p>The identifier pattern for a VDB is <CODE>"name<{@link #DELIMITER_CHAR}>version"</CODE>, 
 * where the name of the VDB and its version represent its unique identifier in the Teiid system.
 * There are no spaces allowed in a given VDB name, and VDB name must start with a letter. 
 * A version number is automatically assigned to a VDB when it is deployed into 
 * a system. A VDB is uniquely identified by <CODE>"name<{@link #DELIMITER_CHAR}>version"</CODE>. 
 * For example: <CODE>"Accounts<{@link #DELIMITER_CHAR}>1"</CODE>, <CODE>"UnifiedSales<{@link #DELIMITER_CHAR}>4</CODE>" etc.
