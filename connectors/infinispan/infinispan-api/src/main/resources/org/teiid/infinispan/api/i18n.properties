TEIID25000=Probuf file define {0} is not found, or incorrect.
TEIID25001=Message Type {0} not found in the proto file, incorrect definition in {1}
TEIID25002=Message Type {0} needs primary key, to include nested document {1}. if working with .proto file you can add @Id on field to indicate that the column is the primary key. Deep nesting is not currently supported.
TEIID25003=Unknown expression type {0}
TEIID25004=Insert/Upsert is not allowed on the table without a primary key. Either do not issue insert/upsert, configure a primary key.
TEIID25005=Insert into cache {0} failed, as cache already has existing entry key {1}
TEIID25006=Importer ignored nested message {0}, as the parent table does not have any identifier setup.
TEIID25007=Aggregate function not supported {0}
TEIID25008=Aggregate functions are not supported on columns of complex objects. Only supported on the main object.
TEIID25009=Parent document {0} with identity {1} not found; Can not perform insert operation.
TEIID25010=Order By is not supported on the nested complex object in Infinispan.
TEIID25011=There are three ways to import the metadata, \n \
    1) Define "importer.ProtoFilePath" to read from a local .proto file.\n \
    2) Define "importer.ProtobufName" property to define .proto file name, when reading the .proto file from the Infinispan Cache directly.\n\
    3) Define the schema using DDL, then use also the "NATIVE" metadata repository to convert DDL into .proto file\n
TEIID25012=The protobuf file {0} is not found in Infinispan, failed to build the schema for the model.
TEIID25013=No primary key on {0}. Insert/Update/Delete operations must be defined with Primary Key on their tables. To define the Primary Key, or identity key do either \n \
    1) Add @Id annotation in the comment field of the message.\n\
    2) Define the Primary Key in the DDL of the Teiid schema. If you are importing the .proto file from Infinispan, you can chain required DDL modifications for schema.
TEIID25014=Cache store {0} not found
TEIID25016=Unknown command is being executed using the direct query procedure. {0}
TEIID25017=Bulk Insert operation is not supported on table {0}, because this structure is a nested document in parent table {1}
TEIID25018=Bulk Upsert operation is not supported currently.
TEIID25019=With Infinispan, since records are stored using the primary key, updating that column is not supported. So, can not update "{0}" column. You can alternatively delete and re-insert the row.
TEIID25020=Cache {0} not found.
proto_error=Error occurred during the registration of the protobuf resource: {0}
no_user=No User name supplied
no_pass=No password supplied
no_realm=No Authentication Realm supplied
no_auth_server=No Authentication server information provided.
no_keystore="EXTERNAL" SASL Mechanism enabled, however no Keystore information provided for SSL
no_truststore="EXTERNAL" SASL Mechanism enabled, however no Truststore information provided for SSL
no_truststore_pass=No Truststore password defined
no_keystore_pass=No Keystore password defined
no_protobuf=No protobuf supplied to register

TEIID25021={0} is not a valid protobuf identifier, please adjust the name or name in source match the regex pattern [a-zA-Z]\w*
