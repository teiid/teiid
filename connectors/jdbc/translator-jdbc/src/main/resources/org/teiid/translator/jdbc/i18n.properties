JDBCTranslator.Unexpected_exception_translating_results___8=Unexpected exception while translating results: {0}



TEIID11004=Error executing statement(s): {0}
TEIID11003=Not using oracle execution payload {0} as hint, since it appears to contain more than just a single comment.
TEIID11002=Failed to report the JDBC driver and connection information
TEIID11006=Teiid runtime names, which are case insensitive, for the imported metadata are not unique.  If not already set, use the setting importer.useFullSchemaName to create Teiid names that include the source schema.
TEIID11017=Invalid name in source sequence format.  Expected <element name> {0} <sequence name>.<sequence value>, but was {1}
TEIID11018=Connection is null; Datasource may not have been defined. Requires a active connection to retrieve the metadata.
TEIID11019=For direct JDBC execution of command "{0}", not any/all parameters are supplied for the prepared jdbc call.
TEIID11020=no alias found on {0}. When native query is being used, then alias name must be defined for table in the query.
TEIID11021=However the client does not support getTypeInfo - and thus Teiid cannot determine which types are unsigned nor array component types.
TEIID11022=Geometry retrieval from a stored procedure is not supported.
TEIID11023=Did not get the expected value type {0} for generated key {1} was {2} instead.
TEIID11024=PI database does not support {0} JOIN capability
TEIID11025=Only TVF functions can be used in LATERAL joins with PI. {0} is NOT a TVF.
TEIID11026=Error getting foreign key information for table {0} of type {1}.  You may need to turn off foreign key import for this source.
TEIID11027=No schemaName nor schemaPattern was specified.  This may result in a long import time or importing from multiple schema.
TEIID11028=useFullSchemaName is true.  This is not recommended behavior.
TEIID11029=More than one schema was imported from.  It is a best practice to import from only one schema - make sure the schemaPattern property is set or the schemaPattern import property is unique.
