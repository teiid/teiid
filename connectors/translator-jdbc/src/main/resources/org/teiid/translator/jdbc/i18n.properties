JDBCTranslator.Unexpected_exception_translating_results___8=Unexpected exception while translating results: {0}



TEIID11004=Error executing statement(s): {0}
TEIID11003=Not using oracle execution payload {0} as hint, since it appears to contain more than just a single comment.
TEIID11002=Failed to report the JDBC driver and connection information
TEIID11006=Teiid runtime names, which are case insensitive, for the imported metadata are not unique.  If not already set, use the setting importer.useFullSchemaName to create Teiid names that include the source schema.
TEIID11017=Invalid name in source sequence format.  Expected <element name> {0} <sequence name>.<sequence value>, but was {1}
TEIID11018=Connection is null; Datasource may not have been defined. Requires a active connection to retrieve the metadata.
TEIID11019=For direct JDBC execution of command "{0}", not any/all parameters are supplied for the prepared jdbc call.
TEIID11020=no alias found on {0}. When native query is being used, then alias name must be defined for table in the query.
TEIID11021=widenUnsignedTypes is enabled (the default).  However the client does not support getTypeInfo - and thus Teiid cannot determine which types are unsigned.
TEIID11022=Geometry retrieval from a stored procedure is not supported.
TEIID11023=Did not get the expected value type {0} for generated key {1} was {2} instead.
