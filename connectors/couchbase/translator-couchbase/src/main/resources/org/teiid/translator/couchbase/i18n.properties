getDocuments.Annotation=Returns json documents that match the given document id or id pattern as BLOBs
getDocuments.id.Annotation=The document id or SQL like pattern of what documents to return, for example, the '%' sign is used to define wildcards (missing letters) both before and after the pattern
getDocuments.keyspace.Annotation=The keyspace name used to retrieve the documents

getDocument.Annotation=Return a json document that match the given document id as BLOB
getDocument.id.Annotation=The document id of what documents to return
getDocument.keyspace.Annotation=The keyspace name used to retrieve the document

TEIID29001=Source-specific Query: {0}
TEIID29002=Execute procedure {0}, query source: {1}
TEIID29003=MetadataProcessor execute N1QL: {0}
TEIID29004=Source-specific Statement: {0}
TEIID29005=All index of nested array are necessary to insert/update/delete item in nested array, {0}
TEIID29006=A documentID is necessary to insert/update/delete nested array, {0}
TEIID29008=Sample size not defined, use default {0}
TEIID29009=No typeNameList defined, a typeNameList is recommended. A typeNameList is a comma-separate list of the attributes that the buckets use to specify document types. Each list item must be a bucket name surrounded by back quotes (`), a colon (:), and an attribute name surrounded by back quotes (`).
TEIID29010=User-defined schema was invalid. The '{0}' schema will be used
TEIID29011=Load all keyspaces via {0}, result {1}
TEIID29012={0} not valid, TypeNameList should be a comma-separate list of the attributes that the buckets use to specify document types. Each list item must be a bucket name surrounded by back quotes (`), a colon (:), and an attribute name surrounded by back quotes (`).
TEIID29013=scanRow, "table:" {0}, "key:" {1} -> "value:" {2}
TEIID29014=Document {0} not contain a array, expected column names are {1}
TEIID29015=Array item out of index, expect length is {0}, expected column names are {1}, array item value is {2}
TEIID29016=Array item mismatch, expect length is {0}, real length is {1}, column names are {2}, array item value is {3}
TEIID29017=Array item do not allow bulk updates, {0}
TEIID29018=documentID, array index do not allow to update, {0}
TEIID29019=documentID and all array index columns must be in equality predicates and separate by AND, {0}
TEIID29020=Max bulk insert documents size must be greater than 0
TEIID29021=retrieve date time Value failed, can not parse {0}, with pattern {1}
TEIID29022=Insert/Update against this source table must use type column value literal matching {0}
TEIID29023=NAMEDTYPEPAIR specified a type column {0} that cannot be found.
TEIID29024=Literal or parameter values are expected for insert values.
TEIID29025=The document ID may not be modified.
