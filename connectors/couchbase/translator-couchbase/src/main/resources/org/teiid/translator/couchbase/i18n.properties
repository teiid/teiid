getDocuments.Annotation=Returns json documents that match the given document id or id pattern as BLOBs
getDocuments.id.Annotation=The document id or SQL like pattern of what documents to return, for example, the '%' sign is used to define wildcards (missing letters) both before and after the pattern
getDocuments.keyspace.Annotation=The keyspace name used to retrieve the documents

getDocument.Annotation=Return a json document that match the given document id as BLOB
getDocument.id.Annotation=The document id of what documents to return
getDocument.keyspace.Annotation=The keyspace name used to retrieve the document

TEIID29004=Source-specific Statement: {0}
TEIID29005=All index of nested array are necessary to insert/update/delete item in nested array, {0}
TEIID29006=A documentID is necessary to insert/update/delete nested array, {0}
TEIID29007=Mismatch of bulk insert columns and parameter values, {0}
TEIID29008=Sample size not defined, use default {0}
TEIID29009=No typeNameList defined, a typeNameList is recommended. A typeNameList is a comma-separate list of the attributes that the buckets use to specify document types. Each list item must be a bucket name surrounded by back quotes (`), a colon (:), and an attribute name surrounded by back quotes (`).
TEIID29010=User-defined schema was invalid. The '{0}' schema will be used
TEIID29011=Load all keyspaces via {0}, result {1}
