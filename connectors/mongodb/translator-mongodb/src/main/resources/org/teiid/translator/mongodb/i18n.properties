TEIID18001=expressions not allowed in insert statement
TEIID18002=expressions not allowed in update statement
TEIID18003=Aggregate function can only contain column references, complex expressions are not allowed.
TEIID18004=In "group by" clause only column references are allowed; complex expressions are not allowed.
TEIID18005=Unknown aggregate function {0}
TEIID18006=Failed to find parent document {0}, with key {1}, to embed document for {2}
TEIID18007=Can not update the root document {0} where the this document {1} is embedded
TEIID18008=Embeddable document {0} is not supplied for update or null.
TEIID18009=Update operation failed to update all the collections that embed this collection
TEIID18010=Failed to delete row(s) from {0} as there are referenced rows in {1}.  
TEIID18011=Missing native-query extension metadata.
TEIID18012=There is no embedded document relationship between tables {0} and {1} to support join
TEIID18013=Table {0} defined both "EMBEDDABLE" and "MERGE" extension properties; you can use one of them on a given Table.
TEIID18014=When working with composite Foreign Keys in table all the key values must be present in the query to build correct look-ups.
TEIID18015=When merging {2} data, the parent document {0} with PK {1} must be available to merge into.
TEIID18016=Update of multi-nested documents is not supported.
TEIID18017=Expressions are not supported in the criteria; use column names.
TEIID18018=Only Literals are supported in the criteria evaluation.
TEIID18019=Must be string based pattern evaluation
TEIID18020=Collection {0} not found in MongoDB repository. 
TEIID18021=Direct Query execution command needs to be in the form "collectionName;{$pipeline instr;}+", Even in the cases of "select *", provide at least $project clause.
TEIID18022=Table {0} embeds table {1}, with given join clause it is not possible to produce valid results as all possible results of table {1} are not available in {0}; Thus this join is not supported.
TEIID18023=Join query can only be based key equality 
TEIID18024=multiple aggregate symbols with different expressions are not supported in single statement, either modify the SQL to have same expression in all aggregate functions or turn off the "supportsAggregatesCount" capability on translator using translator override property to evaluate it in engine. Caution:This may bring in large amount rows into Teiid engine.
TEIID18025=projection clause is empty, the submitted query is currently not supported
TEIID18026=Literal expressions are supported in MongoDB from version 2.6; Upgrade MongoDB version and set database version translator property, or avoid using the Literal expression in select statement
TEIID18027=Any operations on array type column {0} are not supported currently.
TEIID18028=Functions are not supported in query with embedded documents
TEIID18029=Query with OR clause is not supported with embedded documents
TEIID18030=Geo Function that is compared with false is not supported by MongoDB, please re-write your query.
TEIID18031=Use of functions/aggregations is not supported in In clause of MongoDB, please re-write your query.
TEIID18032=Use of functions/aggregations is not supported with Is Null in of MongoDB, please re-write your query.
TEIID18033=Use of functions/aggregations is not supported in Like clause in MongoDB, please re-write your query.
TEIID18034=Failed execute direct query {0}
TEIID18035=Can not update column {0} in table {1} as it is part of primary key, parent document holds the data. To update, you would need to delete the parent column and re-insert as two operations.
TEIID18036=Can not update column {0} in table {1} as it is part of foreign key, parent document holds the data. To update, you would need to delete the parent column and re-insert as two operations.
